Research Project(Currently working on)

This android application is to collect the data of moving container trucks in every interval to analyze the pollution and congestion.
The application contains 5 screens: initial screen, new trip screen, status screen, note screen, and detail status screen.
Also, it uses GPS and GeoCoder to get the current location of truck and convert it to the address.
The data is collected to sql in this format: type of trip, action, latitude, longitude, and timestamp.
These data later on is converted to KML file to see the movement of data.
